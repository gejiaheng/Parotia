## Intro
This is an Android app made for [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com). It incorporates some best practices and modern architecture to Android development. 

Please don't try to publish this app on your behalf, as replicating core user experience of Unsplash including making an unofficial Unsplash for Android app violates the [guideline](https://help.unsplash.com/en/articles/2511257-guideline-replicating-unsplash).

- Entirely written in [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org).
- Uses [Kotlin Coroutines](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/coroutines/coroutines-guide.html) to handle asynchoronous programming.
- Uses [Hilt](https://dagger.dev/hilt/) for easier dependency injection.
- Uses some of the [Architecture Components](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/) which are listed below.

- Inplements a Clean architecture.

It has the following notable dependencies

## Build
You have to have **access key** and **secret key** from Unsplash to build the project. Please apply for your keys on [Unsplash Developers](https://unsplash.com/developers).

To avoid committing keys to the repo, put your keys in your local global gradle.properties file which should be located at *~/.gradle/gradle.properties* on Mac. You can put the keys in the project's gradle.properties file as long as you don't commit them.
